All my projects that are not big enough, or not interesting enough to have their own repository.
You will probably find a lot of shitty not working things. Some things although deserve a bit of attention.

## [Julia Sets Visualizer](https://github.com/KubbyDev/Code/tree/master/CUDA/JuliaMandelbrotVisualizer)

A visualizer that calculates and displays the Mandelbrot set on the left and a Julia set on the right. You can zoom/unzoom and change the shown Julia set by moving the mouse on the left side. The images are rendered using the GPU thanks to the CUDA library. The CPU version I made a while ago took ~500 ms to calculate an image (using only one thread), this one takes ~ 20 ms (I have an Intel core i7-8550U and a Nvidia MX150).

## [Learning Cars](https://github.com/KubbyDev/Code/tree/master/IntelliJ/LearningCars)

A small 2D game that makes cars learn to drive around a circuit using genetic algorithm. This image shows the 5th generation on the training circuit.

## [Viewer 3D](https://github.com/KubbyDev/Code/tree/master/IntelliJ/Viewer3D)

A renderer that can render 3D models in the Wavefront obj format using raycasting (calculates transparency and reflections). This image shows a hollow cube with 2 mirror walls, a green glass wall and an open side. There are 2 lights: on the top of the spike in the cube and above the camera.

## [Neural Network](https://github.com/KubbyDev/Code/tree/master/Eclipse/NeuralNetwork)

My very first attempt to make machine learning. It is capable of recognizing 28x28 images representing digits with 15% errors (from the MNIST database).  
I have done a much better neural network since, in its own repository: [https://github.com/KubbyDev/OCR\_Neural\_Network

## [4 in a Row](https://github.com/KubbyDev/Code/tree/master/Eclipse/Puissance4)

The program that was used for this project:
[![Puissance4](https://i.ibb.co/2NBbK0b/https-i-ytimg-com-vi-Fhdys94-Y70-maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Fhdys94Y70 "Puissance4")  
It was modified a lot for other purposes so it doesn't work anymore.

## [Logic Gate Generator](https://github.com/KubbyDev/Code/tree/master/Eclipse/LogicGateGenerator)

A sort of library that can handle simple logic gates. It can generate logic gates based on a truth table, generate a truth table based on the gate, handle user created gates etc...  
I have done a much better simulator since, in its own repository: [https://github.com/KubbyDev/LogicGateSimulator](https://github.com/KubbyDev/LogicGateSimulator)
