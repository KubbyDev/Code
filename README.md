All my projects that are not big enough, or not interesting enough to have their own repository.
You will probably find a lot of shitty not working things. Some things although deserve a bit of attention.

# In Eclipse:

## Mandelbrot (Java): 
A viewer of the mandelbrot set because I just love this thing. You can zoom/unzoom by left/right clicking.

## LogicGateGenerator (Java): 
A sort of library that can handle simple logic gates. It can generate logic gates based on a truth table, generate a truth table based on the gate, handle user created gates etc...  
I have done a much better simulator since, in its own repository: [https://github.com/KubbyDev/LogicGateSimulator](https://github.com/KubbyDev/LogicGateSimulator)

## Puissance4 (Java): 
The program that was used for this project:
[![Puissance4](https://i.ibb.co/2NBbK0b/https-i-ytimg-com-vi-Fhdys94-Y70-maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Fhdys94Y70 "Puissance4")  
It was modified a lot for other purposes so it doesn't work anymore.

## NeuralNetwork (Java): 
My very first attempt to make machine learning. It is capable of recognizing 28x28 images representing digits with 15% errors (from the MNIST database).  
I have done a much better neural network since, in its own repository: [https://github.com/KubbyDev/OCR\_Neural\_Network

# In IntelliJ:

## LearningCars (JavaScript): 
A small 2D game that makes cars learn to drive around a circuit using genetic algorithm. This image shows the 5th generation on the training circuit.

## Viewer3D (JavaScript): 
A renderer that can render 3D models in the Wavefront obj format using raycasting (calculates transparency and reflections). This image shows a hollow cube with 2 mirror walls, a green glass wall and an open side. There are 2 lights: on the top of the spike in the cube and above the camera.
