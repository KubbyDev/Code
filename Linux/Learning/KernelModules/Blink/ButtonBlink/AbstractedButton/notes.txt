The code from the article used timespec but they are being deprecated because the secoonds field will overflow in 2038
Now the thing to use is timespec64. Some functions like getnstimeofday also have to be replaced (by ktime_get_real_ns)

There was also a problem with the __ATTR macro which is probably also deprecated
I replaced it by the __ATTR_RW macro

Apparently the kernel refuses to compile code with 64-bit divisions because they are slow

I could use the do_div function but I don't know for the modulus so I just used a cast
The code will break in 2038, that's sad :(
