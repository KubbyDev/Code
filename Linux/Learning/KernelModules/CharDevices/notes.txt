To find the list of functions that can be implemented by character or block devices:
cat /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/include/linux/fs.h | cat -n | grep -A 40 "file_operations {"

To give a user access to a device we have to find the entry for that device:
find /sys -name ebbchar
Then we need to find the KERNEL and SUBSYSTEM values for that device:
udevadm info -a -p /sys/class/ebb/ebbchar
Then we can add a udev rule:
echo 'KERNEL=="ebbchar", SUBSYSTEM=="ebb", MODE="0666"' >> /etc/udev/rules.d/*ebbchar*
The files in this directory are of the form PRIORITY-NAME.rules
Priority is a number, files are sorted in lexical order and the first files (lowest numbers) have the highest priority
